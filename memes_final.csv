124,6ca8c2,". vsauce, michel here ＷＨＥＲＥＡＲＥＹＯＵＲＦＩＮＧＥＲＳ？ hey, vsauce. michael here. where are your fingers? seriously. it's a pretty easy question. you should be able to answer it. but how do you know? how does anyone know anything?you might say, well, i know where my fingers are. i'm looking right at them. or, i can touch them, i can feel them, they're right here and that's good. your senses are a great way to learn things. in fact, we have way more than the usual five senses we talk about. for instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception. this is what the police evaluate during a field sobriety test. it allows you to tell where your fingers and arms and head and legs in your body is all in relation to each other without having to look or touch other things. we have way more than five senses, we have at least twice as many and then some. but they're not perfect.there are optical illusions, audio illusions, temperature sensation illusions, even tactile illusions. can you turn your tongue upside down? if so, perfect. try this. run your finger along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down tongue. your tongue will be able to feel your finger, but in the wrong place. our brains never needed to develop an understanding of upside down tongue touch. so, when you touch the right side of your tongue when it's flipped over to your left side you perceive a sensation on the opposite side, where your tongue usually is but isn't when it's upside down. it's pretty freaky and cool and a little humbling, because it shows the limits of the accuracy of our senses, the only tools we have to get what's out there in here.the philosophy of knowledge, the study of knowing, is called epistemology. plato famously said that the things we know are things that are true, that we believe and that we have justification for believing. those justifications might be irrational or they might be rational, they might be based on proof, but don't get too confident because proven is not a synonym for true. luckily, there are things that we can know without needing proof, without needing to even leave the house, things that we can know as true by reason alone. these are things that we know a priori. an example would be the statement ""all bachelors are unmarried."" i don't have to go survey every bachelor on earth to know that that is true. all bachelors are unmarried because that's how we define the word bachelor. of course, you have to know what the words bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place. oh, you do? okay. perfect. that's great. but how do you know?this time i mean functionally, how do you know? where is knowledge biologically in the brain? what are memories made out of? we are a long way from being able to answer that question completely but research has shown that memories don't exist in the brain in single locations. instead, what we call a memory is likely made up of many different complex relationships all over the brain between lots of brain cells, neurons. a major cellular mechanism thought to underlie the formation of memories is long-term potentiation or ltp. when one neuron stimulates another neuron repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime ltp, wiring them more strongly together and that connection can last a long time, even an entire lifetime. a collection of different brain cells, neurons that fire together in a particular order over and over again frequently and repeatedly can achieve long-term potentiation, becoming more sensitive to each other and more ready to fire in the exact same way later on in the future. they're a physical thing in your brain, firing together more easily because you strengthen that pattern of firing. you memorized. this branching forest of firing friends looks messy, but look closer. it could be the memory of your first kiss. a living souvenir of the event. if i were to go into your brain and cut out those cells, could i make you forget your first kiss or could i make you forget where your fingers are? only if i cut out a lot of your brain. because memories aren't just stored in one relationship, they're stored all over the brain. the events leading up to your first kiss are stored in one network, the way it felt to the way it smelled in different networks, all added up together making what you call the memory of your first kiss.how many memories can you fit inside your head? what is the storage capacity of the human brain? the best we can do is a rough estimate, but given the number of neurons in the brain involved with memory and the number of different connections a single neuron can make paul reber at northwestern university estimated that we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5 petabytes of information. that's the equivalent of recording a tv channel continuously for 300 years. that's a lot of information. that is a lot of information about skills you can do and facts and people you've met, things in the real world. the world is real, right? how do you know?it's a difficult question, but it's not rocket science. instead, it is asking whether or not rocket scientists even exist in the first place. the theory that the sun moved around the earth worked great. it predicted that the sun would rise every morning and it did. it wasn't until later that we realized what we thought was true might not be. so, do we or will we ever know true reality or are we stuck in a world where the best we can do is be approximately true? discovering more and more useful theories every day but never actually reaching true objective actual reality. can science or reason ever prove convincingly that your friends and youtube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond your mind? that you don't just live in the matrix?no. your mind is all that you have, even if you use instruments, like a telescope or particle accelerators. the final stop for all of that information is ultimately you. you are alone in your own brain, which technically makes it impossible to prove that anything else exists. it's called the egocentric predicament. everything you know about the world out there depends on and is created inside your brain. this mattered so much to charles sanders peirce that he drew a line between reality, the way the universe truly is, and what he called the phaneron, the world as filtered through our senses and bodies, the only information we can get. if you want to speak with certainty you live in, that is you react to and remember and experience your phaneron, not reality. the belief that only you exist and everything else, food, the universe, your friends are all figments of your mind is called solipsism. there is no way to convince a solipsist that the outside world is real. and there is no way to convince someone who doubts that the universe wasn't created just three seconds ago along with all of our memories. it's a frightening realization that we don't always know how to deal with. there's even the matrix defense.in 2002 tonda lynn ansley shot and killed her landlady. she argued that she believed she was in the matrix, that her crimes weren't real. by using the matrix defense, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity, because the opposite view is just way healthier and common. it's called realism. realism is the belief that the outside world exists independently of your own phaneron. rocks and stars and thora birch would continue to exist even if you weren't around to experience them. but you cannot know realism is true. all you can do is believe.martin gardner, a great source for math magic tricks, explained that he is not a solipsist because realism is just way more convenient and healthy and it works. as to whether it bothered him that he could never know realism was true, he wrote, ""if you ask me to tell you anything about the nature of what lies beyond the phaneron, my answer is how should i know? i'm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries, i can no more grasp what is behind such questions as my cat can understand what is behind the clatter i make while i type this paragraph."" humble stuff. what strikes me is the cat.cats do not understand keyboards, but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be. it's a great way to get the attention of a human, they're warm and exciting, surrounded by noises and flashing lights plus cats love to get their scent on whatever they can, a mark of their existence. we aren't that much different, except instead of keyboards we have the mysteries of the universe. we will never be able to understand all of them.

174,6hzhr7,". let me break down what actually happened if you guys ever watch the video on youtube.  there are four individual things that i noticed.the fact that he is white does matter, but not for racist reasons.  the reason the people in commercials are black is the same reason that there are children in toy commercials and old people in cialis commercials.  we all are wired to trust, listen, and believe people that we can relate to and that we feel are like us.  this officer is around the same age and race as the convict so he is already naturally open to believing him more than he would other people.body language.  the convict in this video tells the officer that he was on a run and continuously positions his body so that it seems he wants to continue on his run.  this is the same way that your legs are actually pointed toward the door when sitting down in a chair three minutes before class ends or a meeting.  we may not be able to call out all the body language cues but 80% of communication is non-verbal so the officer is feeling as if he has interrupted this man and he is trying to polite to allow him to continue on with his run.  this may have not been a coincidence as this convict seems to be a compliance expert (con man) as seen inbuilding trust:  the convict answers every question with an accurate, elaborate answer that seems impossible to make up on the fly. from the scraped up knees to the guy who dropped him off.  this guy's story checked out each time.  he uses humor and disbelief and he even asks questions which makes the officer have to stop and think instead of thinking about his own line of questions. this registers with different parts of the brain and actively engages the officer. the officer's brain associates those neural connections with personal connections and that in turn makes the officer feels like he can trust this man.the icing on the cake is the convict mentioning that he is former military then asking the officer for his phone number.  every film that you watched since you were a child depicts soldiers as hard working, trustworthy, and 100% red white and blue american regardless of the truth.when there are too many facts to sort through for our brains, we lean heavily on simple bits of information like this.  think walking into best buy and you seeing a samsung and haier hdtv.  which would you pick?  this was another checkbox next to the ""trustworthy"" box in the officer's head.  the convict at this point had seen the officer's body language change and as a victory dance, went as far as to ask the officer for his contact information knowing that it would not be given and knowing that it would put the officer's mind at ease about any doubts about his innocence.  this officer drove away feeling 100% certain that this was not their man just as you felt those floor mats, paint protection, and rust proofing will pay off in the long run when you bought that new car.   learn everything you can about this man's skills, you can apply it to your own trade and be a lot more successful.﻿ and to add to this, the officer in the video had an outdated picture of the escapee. try harassing every w m between 5'8'' and 6'2'' in a small town and see what happens. the officer is lucky this convict was as patient as he was due to the cop wasting his time. which he actually did complain about him wasting his time... the cop tried to do the right thing. i hate when people hate on him, because would you want him detaining innocent people for 20-45 minutes because some ""convict escaped somewhere"" and i know its not me!! blah blah. just to add, he first said his name was robert jones (14s), then later calls himself jimmy jones (5:32). if the cop had been paying attention, this should have been a red flag. wow did you also comment this 4 weeks ago on youtube? this was perhaps the best comment i've seen on this shitty sub. copied and pasted from youtube comment on the video. i saw this video like a year ago so i am not sure if i remember correctly but i am pretty sure this convict said 2 different names but the dumb cop didnt notice. stolen from the youtube comments, seriously, check them. lol that's a nice copy paste of the comment section. lol i love your username. excited for foo? 1.8 karma and goldthis guy is a fraud he just copy and pasted the youtube comment from the video. oh no. you wasted a good mans money. where can i buy this book?

""come on, dammit, why won't you cum?"" muttered spongebob as he moved himself sensually up and down the length of sandy's anaconda.at last, the sleeping squirrel climaxed, shooting hot greasy cum from spongebob's ear. he pocketed some of it because he knew krabs would require proof, probably while raping him violently.""mmmrh? who sucked me off?"" murred sandy as she rubbed her eyes.""spongebob, you cheater!"" yelled patrick, his voice muffled by the squirrel's vaginal wall. spongebob ran as fast as his gay little legs would carry him out of sandy's room. squidward was attempting to fuck a tree. why did you write this and why did i read it all my penis shrank into my body after i read this.",True,16,16,bossness00,https://i.redd.it/5xmpw5nfet8z.jpg,0,Truly amazing!😩😱,1499714082.0,140,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wNdjQPFdbOmtc1gk6z4RxZvgRqgmNjK-nXYEN3Jxzas.jpg,119,18278

237,6o854h,". ron doesn't need editing to be . seriously? cuba's gdp has grown annually by an average rate of 4.74% since 1994. in the years from the capitalist crisis until now (2008-2012) it has grown by an average of 3.6% - compare this to imperialist britain, where it has 'grown' by an average of, ahem, -4.4%. unlike in the imperialist countries cuba's growth has not been sustained off plundering the world and squeezing the working class. even in the worst years of the special period - the years following the destruction of the ussr, where 35% of gdp and 80% of trade was lost practically overnight - it didn't shut down one hospital or old person's home, nobody starved, and nobody was made homeless. and this is in the context of a 53-year blockade implemented by the us which had cost cuba over $236bn by january 2011. cuba has a 'high' hdi index - 0.78. it is the only country in the world to have sustainable development as measured by the wwf. its healthcare system is universally understood as one of the best in the world - it sends more doctors overseas than the entire who. and this is in the context of it being a small caribbean island which was as unequal and poor as any other before the revolution. if you want to see what cuban socialism really means, put these basic facts in the context of a jamaica (whose post-crisis gdp has shrunk by an annual average of -1.1%, has 17.6% of people living under the national poverty line, and is facing imf-imposed austerity measures which include a 20% real-terms cut in wage) or a haiti (where 78% of people live on less than $2 a day). it has economic issues it needs to resolve - an increased productivity to combat the dual currency, for example - but these problems would not even exist were it not for the us blockade, and it is already working on resolving them. to argue that it is completely stagnant is completely ridiculous by anyone's measure. you got the word right outta my mouth m8 beat me to it tldr:  this but unironically i'm not the only one who didn't read all this, am i? ah, the bay of pigs argument.....hows about i throw arobert f kennedy was assassinated by the fbi/ciain there? k r/unexpectedcommunism [citation needed] source of this pasta? it's not hard to grow your gdp percentage when it's like $27 you've never been to cuba have you?",True,15,15,Oryon-,https://i.redd.it/111morocmjaz.jpg,0,serious shit,1500467497.0,140,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8VlgVMfndHcgIqVXi70ALSaOdbjvo6SPLN2TbQmJXe0.jpg,140,24412

447,79y4p0,"i say kids are plenty old enough to learn how to properly handle a battle tank by the time they're out trick or treating, let's not coddle them too much. back when i was growing up, infants were taught how to fire assault weapons. these kids nowadays need to toughen up but don't you know that tanks cause autism? we should start having tankery classes! (also let's put schools on giant-ass boats) the m4a3e8 is a medium tank, not a battle tank.  main battle tanks came later. coddle? good thing you asked, the sherman tanks may be most famous for their design in which the front of the tank slopes down at a 56-degree angle. shermans, in general, had anywhere from 2-3 inches of armor around the body. the roof was lighter, with some variations having as little as .98 inches of armor there. guns also had armor protecting them as well, with the main gun having between 1.97 inches to 2.52 inches of armor, depending on the exact model of tank. the m4a3e2 sherman jumbo was the most overall well-protected, with over 4 inches of armor protecting its body. this design had a 47-inch slope, which resulted in that part of the tank having up to 8 inches of armor. because of the added weight, this model only had a max speed of 22 miles per hour. research done on the m-4 sherman tanks found that for every 1.89 shell penetrations to a tank, the tank would catch fire 82 percent of the time. much of this could be attributed to ammunition fires. the resolution to this was to place the ammunition in a “wet storage,” which essentially places the ammunition around water pockets. this proved effective, reducing the likelihood of a fire after being hit to just around 15 percent, while “dry storage” resulted in a fire after being penetrated, about 60 to 80 percent of the time. cant believe my kid almost ate that 😱. thanks deborah you're welcome sharon 🙌👏 is this in vancouver? looks like a place close to my office lol yup. came here to say the same. definitely right by the viaduct there it's the british columbia regiment in downtown vancouver.http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/bc-regiment/index.page beatty street drill hall came to say this, but you win this round. i'd take a tank in my pocky anyday🤷‍♂️ that tank wouldn't have got into that packet and it is absurd and childish to have suggested such.mods can you please remove this post.cheers-m lmao who gives out pocky fucking weebs",False,17,19,Zeustah-,https://i.redd.it/duwxh5flu7vz.jpg,0,Please 🅱 Careful.,1509477671.0,140,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5ZwGpE_5k6nAv1lUdMaqydAneQ2NUzlU2DFKi5_dsOM.jpg,140,27496

549,7jj5s0,". just checked, it has 3.5k upvotes shh... well now it has 3,499. yeah op is a turtleneck it has 3.5k upvotes. this post being upvoted endorses a disingenuous behaviour! you may be onto something here. memes used to be simple. relatable. worth a chuckle. then they evolved. new formats, new tag lines, new content that was then turned into a new meme. then memes became increasingly meta and self reflective. they parodied themselves and the users who both made them and consumed them. they built off of one another. they grew. they morphed into something entirely novel. this progressed to the point where even that wasn't enough. they had to become something more than themselves. they became surreal. they became deep fried and nuked. each flavor building off of the last and transforming into a nearly intangible, unknown entity. art progressed in a similar fashion. started off simple, i'm talking cave drawing simple. then some pottery and some small abstract sculptures. subjects everyone could relate to and understand. then, as technology allowed for the creation of cultures and societies, art began to reflect that change and it evolved along with it. by the ancient greeks and romans, art had become a more advanced version of the stone and bronze age arts. better drawings, paintings, and the addition of mosaics. sculptures eventually shifted from stylistic expression to naturalistic representation. still accessible to everyone, yet more nuanced and complex. after the fall of rome art stagnated and didn't change very much for nearly a millennium. early christian art dominated for the most part, consisting of murals and frescos and simple statues. all of which were based on the ancient styles. romanesque and gothic art also built upon these precedents. this all changed when the renaissance attacked. a cultural explosion changed the art world forever; arguably starting with the italian artist, giotto. he began using techniques like foreshortening and linear perspective so that the material world could be represented as it appeared to us. a callback to the naturalistic stylings of the greeks. almost like a reference to the days of yore. a celebration of how art used to be, but with the explosion of new techniques and technologies, the art grew increasingly diverse. new and improved frescoes, meticulously crafted sculptures, architectural marvels and the inclusion of new materials in these works. instead of tempera, oil was introduced along with new styles of depicting light and shadow through sfumato and chiaroscuro. these techniques and stylistic changes, while impressive, were simply an advancement of pre established art. the renaissance paved the way for the explosion and diversification of dozens of art movements that followed. from prehistoric art to the end of the renaissance, art was mostly about the same subjects and used similar techniques to accomplish the goal of producing a work of art. yes, the technical proficiency exponentially improved but considering the centuries in between, few true advancements were made. compare this to memes. they were so simple at first and really were nothing more. then they got better. more technical. more circumstantial. more media to create them with. but memes could last years or many months before dying off. as time went on, the longevity of a meme shortened. this is paralleled in the art world. after the renaissance the baroque period started. then the neo-classicism, romantic, realism, and impressionism movements not long after. still utilizing the same technical process but the reasoning behind the movements changed. no longer was it about simply depicting the world around us, it was about prompting the viewer to consider new thoughts and ideas. urging them to look past the image and think deeper about meaning and context. pushing the boundaries of what art could be. the baroque to impressionism era spanned roughly 300 years. compare that to the thousands of years between archaic art and the renaissance. it was a huge explosion of self expression. finally, in the mid to late 19th century starting with post-impressionism, modern art emerged. this movement focused on self-consciousness, self-reference, introspection, existentialism, and even nihilism. i'm talking fauvism, cubism, futurism, dada, abstract expressionism, and surrealism to name the most well known. these styles changed what art could be. they were no longer about depicting life as is, or layering a painting with hidden motifs for only the privileged to understand, they were in and of themselves absurd. abstract shapes, aggressive lines and colors, nonsensical dreamscapes. but it didn't stop there. post-modernism. pushing art to the limit of its potential. pop art, conceptual art, minimalism, fluxus, installation art, lowbrow art, performance art, digital art, earth art. these movements are about skepticism, irony, rejecting grand narratives and reason and instead embracing the idea that knowledge and truth are the result of social, historical, and political discourse and subsequently are a subjective, social construct. it's irreverent and self-referential. it's avant-garde pushed to 11. but what's next? post-postmodernism? metamodernism? hypermodernity? who knows? only time will tell. this is where memes are headed. they started off slow but have picked up so much momentum they're evolving at an exponential pace. they used to hang around for a couple years at most. then it turned to months. then maybe only one month. suddenly it was a week tops. while some particularly great memes do still stick around much like the masterpieces of art in the past, new memes are created every day, every few hours. new movements of memes are being created all the time. anti-memes.  memes. abstract memes. wholesome memes. surreal memes. deep fried memes. nuked memes. even black hole memes, time travel, and dimensional memes are now a reality. what's going to happen next? a return to the classics? a new format so brilliant it steals all our hearts and then starts a whole new movement? i'm excited for the future of memes. agree too long press f to pay respect for this message new copypasta time? make a tl;dr nerd a little bit shorter and it could have been an excellent copypast :( me too thanks yeah f holy shit man there is no such thing as a meme resume. memes are just a silly and easy way to make jokes often by purposely reducing a complex idea into a simpler parody of itself. i'm glad they've brought you so much excitement over the years but surely you see how claiming to have a meme resume is ridiculous.i don't have a napkin resume despite using them for years. in fact i once worked at a restaurant and distributed thousands of napkins. not to boast but i've even drawn pictures on napkins from time to time. i'm so good i can improvise a napkin out of a paper towel.you didn't cut your

872,8bw58q,". lol this shit better not be real i thought the same thing, but it’s real. generally in these circles there is a lot of infighting. recently a trans woman (man? i really don't know, man>woman) started winning pretty much every weightlifting competition for women. on one side this was praised, on the other side, the biological women are shitting bricks as they are almost impossible to win now. how can it be real if our eyes aren't real? ikr! you're either being inclusive or you're not. to ban any person from pride goes against the whole point of inclusiveness. drag queens are the very reason there is even pride or the gay rights movement at all. martha p. washington y’all. that's why ""free pride glasgow"" never actually managed to gather enough support to host even a single parade, the organizer(s) having failed on their first attempt back in 2015 and giving up on the idea of an alternative parade to glasgow's main one after that.and yes, that does mean that the daily wire just issued a april 11, 2018 report on 2015 drama from a group which had insignificant levels of support to begin with. sorry to bother but could you explain which people are “drag queens”? (not being ironic, seriously i don’t know) i think it's just the dressing thing that they banned. they’re eating their own next they'll ban gays so it doesn't offend the pansexuals then pans to not offend pansexuals. haha! you can't have sex with a pan. it's got no holes. or ban the parade so that they don't offend that other religion.",True,15,15,Sumojoe118,https://imgur.com/FuomzMp.jpg,0,Top 10 Anime Betrayals,1523589541.0,140,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-CUPoEOmtKraxWDXYWLegyzIdfeH7UjWagyRF1TlqRM.jpg,140,27241
